# Final Presentation & Raw Tableau Exploration:

The workbook begins with the final presentation, and after viewing each slide of the final presentation you can view the raw Tableau analysis in the following slides. In the menu at the top, every slide prior to "END OF PRESENTATION" is part of the final presentation and every slide after "END OF PRESENTATION" is part of the exploratory analysis done using Tableau. Both the final presentation and the raw exploration were inlcuded in one Tableau presentation for ease of viewing and switching back and forth between them.
